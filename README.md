# BFD-setter — Building Flow's AI Appointment Setter

BFD-setter is Building Flow Digital's internal codebase for the **Building Flow** AI appointment-setter platform — an AI setter (Gary) that works inbound leads over **SMS and AI voice calls** and books them into the client's calendar, using GoHighLevel, Supabase, Retell and Trigger.dev.

> **Channel scope, as built:** BFD is **SMS + voice only** today. Outbound email and outbound social DM
> are **not live**, and the cadence engine hard-fails non-SMS outbound on purpose. Inbound DM and
> WhatsApp plumbing exists (`receive-dm-webhook`) but is a roadmap item, not a shipped capability.
> Do not promise email or DM to a client. Source: [`SOP/CLIENT_ONBOARDING_SOP.md`](./SOP/CLIENT_ONBOARDING_SOP.md) §"Channel scope".

> Forked from an upstream OSS project on 2026-04-14 (see git history for lineage). BFD maintains a divergent fork; all upstream branding was removed in the 2026-07-10 branding purge.

## What This Is

A business connects their GoHighLevel sub-account. A lead messages them. The AI setter replies automatically — handling objections, booking appointments, following up — without the business touching anything.

This is the complete platform source code: the React dashboard, all 97 Supabase Edge Functions, the Trigger.dev background task engine, and the database schemas.

---

## Architecture

Four services. All must be connected and configured for the system to work.

```
Lead sends message (SMS today; Instagram / Facebook plumbed but not live)
        ↓
GoHighLevel fires webhook
        ↓
Supabase Edge Function  (frontend/supabase/functions/)
  - Identifies the client
  - Queues the message
  - Triggers the Trigger.dev task
        ↓
Trigger.dev  (trigger/)
  - Waits out the debounce window
  - Groups messages from the same contact
  - Runs the native text engine (processSetterReply.ts):
    reads setter prompt + chat history, generates the AI reply
  - Sends the reply direct via Twilio (GHL mirrored)
        ↓
GoHighLevel sends reply to lead
        ↓
Dashboard  (frontend/src/)
  - Shows live execution status
  - Manages setter configuration
  - Analytics, contacts, campaigns
```

> **Current state (2026-07):** the AI reply runs on the **native text engine** (`trigger/processSetterReply.ts`; `use_native_text_engine` is mandatory), and outbound SMS is sent **direct via Twilio** (GHL is mirrored, not the send path). The upstream fork's n8n workflow layer was decommissioned and its last in-repo remnants were removed in the 2026-07-10 branding purge. See [Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the authoritative wiring.

**Deployment topology** (hosts that run BFD-setter in production):

- **Frontend dashboard** → Railway production service (renamed from the legacy upstream name 2026-07-10; auto-deploys on `git push origin main`)
- **Edge functions + platform Postgres** → Supabase (`bjgrgbgykvjrsuwwruoh`)
- **Background tasks** → Trigger.dev cloud (`proj_fdozaybvhgxnzopabtse`)

Lovable hosts nothing for BFD. Operational runbook: [`SOP/RUNBOOK.md`](./SOP/RUNBOOK.md). Env reference (archived snapshot): [`Docs/archive/RAILWAY_ENV.md`](./Docs/archive/RAILWAY_ENV.md).

## What You Need

Before you start, you need accounts on these services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **GoHighLevel** | CRM — sends webhooks when leads message, receives AI replies |
| **Supabase** | Platform database + Edge Functions (the webhook API layer) |
| **Trigger.dev** | Runs the background tasks in `/trigger`, including the native text engine |
| **OpenRouter** | LLM API used for AI generation |

You also need a second Supabase project per client (for their leads, chat history, and prompts).

---

## Environment Variables

**Trigger.dev** (set in Trigger.dev Dashboard → Environment Variables):

| Variable | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API |

**Frontend** (create `frontend/.env.local` from `frontend/.env.example`):

| Variable | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API |

---

## High-Level Setup Steps

See [Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the system source of truth, and [SOP/GHL_SETUP.md](./SOP/GHL_SETUP.md) for the GoHighLevel operator guide (forms, tags, automations, webhooks + verification checklist). The full doc index is in [Docs/README.md](./Docs/README.md).

## This Is Not a Tutorial

This repo is BFD's internal codebase. It is not a step-by-step setup guide. It contains the complete source code, all Edge Functions, database schemas, and background tasks, but it does not walk you through how to configure each service, wire the webhooks, structure your GHL sub-account, or connect all the layers together.

BFD offers Building Flow as a done-for-you service: we deploy, debug, monitor, and tune Gary (the AI receptionist) on your real inbound. Contact Brendan at brendan@buildingflowdigital.com to scope a 7-day Building Flow Pilot.
