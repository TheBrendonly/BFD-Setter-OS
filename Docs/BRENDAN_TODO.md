# BFD-Setter — Brendan's Manual / UI Todo List

Things only Brendan can do (UI clicks, logins, provider dashboards, business calls). Reconciled 2026-06-25.
Testing actions live in `TEST_LIST.md`; first-paying-client onboarding actions live in `DEFERRED.md`.

## Active (do when you have time)

- [ ] **5.1 Setup-guide screenshot re-shoot** — review and refresh. Lock the canonical BFD Retell **folder name** first, then the screenshots/text in `SetupGuideDialog.tsx` can be re-shot (it still says create a folder named "1Prompt"). `[B]`
- [ ] **B-4 minor decision** — for the settings split, decide which workspace settings (brand voice, contact hours, voicemail, logo) a **client** may self-edit inside their "My Account" vs which stay admin-only. (Feeds the B-4 build.) `[B]`

## After a build ships (I'll prompt you with the exact agent/version)

- [ ] **Re-Save the 5 voice setters** once the B-5/B-3 fix ships (default-vars net + outbound version re-pin) so it takes on the live agents. The 5: Main Outbound (slot 1), Gary Property Coach / Mortgage Broker / Finance Strategist / Crazy Gary. **Never edit the prompts — re-Save/Push only.**
- [ ] **Apply any report-only prompt tweaks** I surface, via the BFD setter UI (prompt content is hard report-only).

## Notes

- The inbound number `+61481614530` answers on a dedicated **"Inbound BFD Agent"** (`agent_b2f6495`) with the neutral greeting — confirmed correct 2026-06-25.
- Outbound calls pick the setter at the **campaign/workflow level** — no setter needs an outbound binding (only one setter is flagged inbound). This is the model the F2 build implements.
